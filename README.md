File recovery from storage media is a cyber security theme based project that helps in recovering lost or deleted files from a pendrive with specific extensions like .jpg, .png, .pdf etc.
This project uses pattern matching algorithms to find the starting and ending signatures of the required files and recovers accordingly.
The user interface is simple and recovered files are classified into respective folders accordingly.
